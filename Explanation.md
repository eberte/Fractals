# Julia Set and Mandelbrot Set Connectedness
Mandelbrot sets differ from the Julia set in that z is defined at first as zero and c varies depending on what you input so you are testing the magnitude of c from z ^ 2 + c
While in Julia sets z and c are variables so z_0 changes the original periphiral point which gives the disconnectedness of many Julia sets since the peripheral point is changed from (0, 0) to the given z point which means you start testing from that point that is why there are infinitely many julia sets and only one mandelbrot set. Also since z is a variable the farther away z_0 is from the accepted Mandelbrot set the more likely the numbers in the julia set will be not in the Mandelbrot which means it will be more disconnected.
