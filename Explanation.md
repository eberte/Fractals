# Julia Set and Mandelbrot Set Connectedness
Mandelbrot sets differ from the Julia set in that z is defined at first as zero and c varies depending on what you input so you are testing the magnitutde of c from z**2 + c
While in Julia sets z and c are variables so z sub 0 changes the original periphiral point which gives the disconnectedness of many Julia sets since the peripheral point is changed from (0, 0) to the given z point which means you start testing from that point as the center of the circle that is why there are infinitely many julia sets and only one mandelbrot set
